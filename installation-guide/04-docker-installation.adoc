== Deploying FrontLine using Docker

Running FrontLine with Docker is the recommended solution, as it requires the minimal amount of setup and is the easiest way to upgrade to newer versions.

<<docker-compose, Docker compose>>

=== Getting FrontLine's Docker image

FrontLine's image is hosted as a private image on https://hub.docker.com/r/gatlingcorp/frontline[Docker Hub].

Please contact our support and provide us with your Docker Hub username so we can grant you access.

=== Setup Cassandra

The following command will start a single-node Cassandra cluster, using the official Cassandra image.
This will also mount a local directory on the host into the container, to persist its data across starts/stops of the Cassandra container.

----
docker run -d \
  --name cassandra \
  -v <local directory to store Cassandra data>:/var/lib/cassandra \
  -p 9042:9042 \
  cassandra:3.11.6
----

=== Copy FrontLine default configuration

To be able to persist FrontLine (required, as it stores the license information and key used for data encryption), create a directory and copy <<frontline-default-conf,FrontLine's default configuration>> to a file named `frontline.conf`.

=== Setup FrontLine

The following command will start FrontLine, mapping to its default port on the host.
This will also mount two volumes:

* A volume with FrontLine's configuration, prepared by the previous step.
* A volume to store uploaded privateÂ keys (required by features like Git cloning and by some cloud providers)

----
docker run -d \
  --name frontline \
  -p 10542:10542 \
  -v <configuration directory from the previous step>:/opt/frontline/conf \
  -v <local directory to store private keys>:/opt/frontline/keys \
  gatlingcorp/frontline:{revnumber}
----

NOTE: Depending on your needs, you may need to configure additional volumes on the FrontLine container (SSL certificate if HTTPS is configured, or keystore/truststore for LDAP support)

[#docker-compose]
=== Docker compose

For your convenience, here are some docker compose instructions to set up a quick test environment. This is enough to start FrontLine locally.

Cassandra container::

Based on cassandra image `cassandra:3.11.6`, you'll have to bind a local directory on the volume to store and keep your data. A healthcheck will be started on the container.

FrontLine container::

Wait until cassandra container healthcheck indicates that all is well.
Set the version of FrontLine you want to deploy, bind a local directory for FrontLine configuration and keys.

==== Prerequisite

Create a folder to store the files, add the given `docker-compose.yml`, then run `docker-compose up -d`.
Once ready, visit FrontLine at link:http://localhost:10542[http://localhost:10542]!
