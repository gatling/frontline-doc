## Purpose of this GitHub Action

This Action enables you to start a Gatling Enterprise simulation directly from your GitHub Actions workflows.

This plugin doesn't create a new Gatling Enterprise simulation, you have to create it using the Gatling Enterprise Dashboard before.

Don't forget to check out [GitHub's official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to learn how to write CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions.

## Action coordinates

The Action is published with the following coordinates: `gatling/enterprise-action@v1`.

You can check out the latest releases available [from the GitHub project](https://github.com/gatling/enterprise-action/releases). You generally only need to specify the major version you want to use, currently `v1`.

## Pre-requisites

You must first [create an API token]({{< ref "../../admin/api-tokens" >}}), with at least the **Start** permission. It will be used by the Action to authenticate with Gatling Enterprise. We recommend storing the API Token [in a GitHub encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow). In the following examples, we assume the **API Token** is stored in a secret called `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN`.

The Action will also need the **URL for your Gatling Enterprise instance**. In the following examples, we will use `http://my-gatling-instance.my-domain.tld`, but you must replace it with the correct URL for your Gatling Enterprise Self-Hosted instance. Please also note that it **must be accessible** from the GitHub Action runners you plan to use (either the [GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/) or your own [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/)).

We also assume that you have already [configured a simulation]({{< ref "../../user/simulations" >}}) on Gatling Enterprise. You can copy the simulation ID from the simulations list view. In the following examples, we will show the simulation ID as `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

## Quickstart (minimal job configuration)

In this example, we configure a workflow which will only start a simulation as already configured and uploaded on Gatling Enterprise. We use the `workflow_dispatch` trigger event, so that we can [run it manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow), but feel free to use what works for your use case.

```yaml
name: Run Gatling Enterprise Simulation

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      simulation_id:
        type: string
        required: true

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Gatling Enterprise Action
        uses: gatling/enterprise-action@v1
        with:
          gatling_enterprise_url: http://my-gatling-instance.my-domain.tld
          api_token: ${{ secrets.GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN }}
          simulation_id: ${{ inputs.simulation_id }}
```

Push this to your repository's default branch (otherwise, new `workflow_dispatch` workflows don't get detected). You can then run the workflow from you GitHub repository's Actions tab. Select the workflow's name from the menu on the left, and click on Run workflow.

## Configuration reference

Several configuration options are available as Action inputs. This Action also provides several outputs which you can access in the following steps of your workflow.

### Inputs

Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: gatling/enterprise-action@v1
    with:
      gatling_enterprise_url: http://my-gatling-instance.my-domain.tld
      api_token: ${{ secrets.GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN }}
      simulation_id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
      extra_system_properties: >
        {
          "sys_prop_1":"value 1",
          "sys_prop_2":42,
          "sys_prop_3":true
        }
      extra_environment_variables: >
        {
          "ENV_VAR_1":"value 1",
          "ENV_VAR_2":42,
          "ENV_VAR_3":true
        }
      fail_action_on_run_failure: true
      wait_for_run_end: true
      run_summary_enabled: true
      run_summary_initial_refresh_interval: 5
      run_summary_initial_refresh_count: 12
      run_summary_refresh_interval: 60
```

- `gatling_enterprise_url` {{< badge danger >}}required{{< /badge >}}: The URL for your Gatling Enterprise Self-Hosted instance (if not specified, it will point to Gatling Enterprise Cloud instead).

- `api_token` {{< badge danger >}}required{{< /badge >}} (unless using an environment variable named `GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN` instead): The API token used by the Action to authenticate with Gatling Enterprise.

- `simulation_id` {{< badge danger >}}required{{< /badge >}}: The ID of the simulation as configured on Gatling Enterprise.

- `extra_system_properties` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}}: Additional Java system properties, will be merged with the simulation's configured system properties. Must be formatted as a JSON object containing the desired key/value pairs. Values can be strings, numbers or booleans.

- `extra_environment_variables` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}}: Additional environment variables, will be merged with the simulation's configured environment variables. Must be formatted as a JSON object containing the desired key/value pairs. Values can be strings, numbers or booleans.

- `fail_action_on_run_failure` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `true`): If `true`, the Action will fail if the simulation run ends in an error (including failed assertions). Note: if set to `false` and the simulation ends in an error, some of the outputs may be missing (e.g. there will be no assertion results if the simulation crashed before the end).

- `wait_for_run_end` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `true`): If `true`, the Action will wait for the end of te simulation run on Gatling Enterprise before terminating. Note: if set to `false`, some of the outputs may be missing (there will be no status nor assertion results).

- `run_summary_enabled` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `true`): Assuming `wait_for_run_end` is also true, will regularly log a summary of the ongoing run to the console until it finishes. See also the [logs section]({{< ref "#logs" >}}).

- `run_summary_initial_refresh_interval` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `5`): Initial interval before displaying a new summary of the ongoing run in the console, in seconds. Should be a multiple of 5 (otherwise it will be rounded up). Only used a limited number of times (set by `run_summary_initial_refresh_count`) before switching to the interval set by run_summary_refresh_interval. See also the [logs section]({{< ref "#logs" >}}).

- `run_summary_initial_refresh_count` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `12`): Number of times to use `run_summary_initial_refresh_interval` as the interval before displaying a new summary of the ongoing run in the console. After that, `run_summary_refresh_interval` will be used. This allows to avoid spamming the log output once the test run is well underway. See also the [logs section]({{< ref "#logs" >}}).

- `run_summary_refresh_interval` {{< badge info >}}optional{{< /badge >}} (defaults to `60`): Interval before displaying a new summary of the ongoing run in the console, in seconds. Should be a multiple of 5 (otherwise it will be rounded up). See also the [logs section]({{< ref "#logs" >}}).

### Outputs

Example:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: gatling-enterprise-action
    uses: gatling/enterprise-action@v1
    with:
      gatling_enterprise_url: http://my-gatling-instance.my-domain.tld
      api_token: ${{ secrets.GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN }}
      simulation_id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
  - run: |
      echo "run_id=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.run_id }}"
      echo "reports_url=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.reports_url }}"
      echo "runs_url=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.runs_url }}"
      echo "run_status_code=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.run_status_code }}"
      echo "run_status_name=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.run_status_name }}"
      echo "run_assertions=${{ steps.enterprise-action.outputs.run_assertions }}"
```

- `run_id`: The ID of the run started by this action.

- `reports_url`: The URL of the reports page for this run.

- `runs_url`: The URL of the runs history page for this simulation.

- `run_status_name`: The name of the run's final status (e.g. `Successful`, `AssertionsSuccessful`, `AssertionsFailed`, etc.).

- `run_status_code`: The code of the run's final status.

- `run_assertions`: The results of the run's assertions, as a JSON array.

### Logs

Every few seconds, the action logs to the GitHub Action console a summary of the run's current status. When the run ends, the Action logs the status of the run and the results of any assertions. Here's a very short duration example:

{{< img src="reference_logs.png" alt="A run's logs in the GitHub Actions console" >}}

By default, logs are printed every 5 seconds the first 12 times (i.e. during 60 seconds), then every 60 seconds. This can be adjusted using the inputs `run_summary_initial_refresh_interval`, `run_summary_initial_refresh_count`, and `run_summary_refresh_interval`. The ongoing logs can also be completely disabled using the input `run_summary_enabled: false`: in this case, only the final results will be printed.

### Cancellation

When the Action starts, it registers a post-execution, clean-up task in the workflow. If the Action fails or gets cancelled by a user, and if the simulation is still running on Gatling Enterprise, this clean-up task will attempt to cancel the execution on Gatling Enterprise.

## Sample use cases

### Building from sources

In this example, we assume you have configured your repository on Gatling Enterprise to [build from sources]({{< ref "../../user/repositories/#downloading-from-sources" >}}), from your GitHub repository's `main` branch. Every time the code on the `main` branch gets updated, we run the updated simulation on Gatling Enterprise.

Feel free to use different trigger events or to configure the other inputs and outputs for the Action as documented above, according to your own use case. But keep in mind that Gatling Enterprise will only download and run your simulation scripts from the branch set [in the simulation configuration]({{< ref "../../user/simulations/#option-1-build-from-sources" >}})!

```yaml
name: Run Gatling Enterprise Simulation

# Execute the workflow on each push to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Here we use concurrency to cancel previous executions if they are still
# ongoing. Useful to avoid running the same simulation several times
# simultaneously if we push several code changes in a short time.
# See https://docs.github.com/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency.
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Run the simulation on Gatling Enterprise
      # If it is configured to "build from sources" from the branch "main",
      # it will download and run the updated version of the code
      - name: Gatling Enterprise Action
        uses: gatling/enterprise-action@v1
        with:
          gatling_enterprise_url: http://my-gatling-instance.my-domain.tld
          api_token: ${{ secrets.GATLING_ENTERPRISE_API_TOKEN }}
          simulation_id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
```

### Using a binary repository

This workflow is defined in the GitHub repository which contains your Gatling simulation script built with one of our build tools plugins. In this example, every time the code on the `main` branch gets updated, we build, package, and publish the current version of the simulation script, before starting the simulation on Gatling Enterprise.

In this example, we assume that:
- You have configured your repository on Gatling Enterprise to [download from a binary repository]({{< ref "../../user/repositories/#downloading-from-a-binary-repository" >}}), using Artifactory or Sonatype Nexus.
- You have [configured your simulation]({{< ref "../../user/simulations/#option-2-download-binary-from-repository" >}}) to use the version marker `latest.integration` for the artifact published on the binary repository.
- Your build is properly configured to publish to the binary repository, using [Maven](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/extensions/maven_plugin/#publish-to-a-binary-repository), [Gradle](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/extensions/gradle_plugin/#publish-to-a-binary-repository), or [SBT](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/extensions/sbt_plugin/#publish-to-a-binary-repository).
