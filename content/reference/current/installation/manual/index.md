## Upgrading From a Previous Version

{{< alert warning >}}
Your current Gatling Enterprise version must be at least 1.6.2. Otherwise, you must first upgrade to Gatling Enterprise 1.11.1.
{{< /alert >}}

Inside the Gatling Enterprise installation folder, there are two directories to backup:

* The `conf` directory with all its content
* The `keys` directory with all its content

They can be carried from one version to the other without any modification.
However, it is recommended to check the newer `conf/frontline.conf` configuration file for any new added parameters that could be useful before replacing it with your backup.

The data is stored using the Cassandra database and will most likely be found in the `/var/lib/cassandra` directory, but might vary depending on how you've installed Cassandra.

### Upgrading process

* Stop Gatling Enterprise

It can be done by removing a file named `FRONTLINE_RUNNING` in the Gatling Enterprise installation folder and waiting 10 seconds.

You can also find the process and kill it directly.

* Stop the Cassandra database

If using systemd, perform the command `systemctl stop cassandra`. Otherwise, you'll have to find the process and kill it manually.

* Make a backup of your Cassandra data, most likely in `/var/lib/cassandra`
* [Download and unzip updated Gatling Enterprise bundle]({{< ref "#download-gatling-enterprise" >}})
* Copy `conf` directory content from previous installation to the new one
* Copy `keys` directory from previous installation (if it exists) to the new one:

```console
cp -r previous_frontline_folder/keys new_frontline_folder
```

* Start the Cassandra database

If using systemd, do a `systemctl start cassandra`. It is also possible to start cassandra using it's binary directly in its installation folder: `./bin/cassandra`

* Start the new Gatling Enterprise process

Go to the installation folder, and perform the following command: `./bin/frontline`. More details in the [launch section]({{< ref "#launch-gatling-enterprise" >}}).

### Upgrading from Cassandra 3 to Cassandra 4

If you are currently using Cassandra 3 with Gatling Enterprise, you may want to upgrade to the latest version of Cassandra 4.
The upgrade is pretty simple, keep the same `cassandra.yaml` and modify the following configuration:

```yaml
num_tokens: 16
```

## Processor Architecture

We support both AMD64 and ARM for both Gatling Enterprise and Gatling injectors.

## JDK

Gatling Enterprise components run on a JVM and require a modern Hotspot-based JDK 8, 11 or 17.

We recommend you use JDK builds from [Azul System's Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&package=jdk).

Other JVMs such as OpenJ9 are not supported.

{{< alert warning >}}
- Cassandra 3 supports only JDK 8, while Cassandra 4 supports JDK 8 & 11.
- JDK 11 and 17 support is limited to Gatling Enterprise server and Gatling injectors only.
{{< /alert >}}

## Linux

{{< alert warning >}}
- the Gatling Enterprise server and the Gatling injectors are intended to be running on Linux 64 bits.
- Injectors are intended to run on Kernel >= 3.10.
- It's possible to use OSX as a development environment.
- Windows and Unix platforms such Solaris or AIX are not supported.
{{< /alert >}}

As Gatling Enterprise is about duration measurement and logging events in time, we advice that:

* your system clock is properly synchronized from an NTP server
* you disable power saving Linux features, so clock source doesn't actually shift and stays monotonic

Make sure that the JVM processes run with a user with sound permissions.

## Cassandra

### Important: Backups

{{< alert warning >}}
We recommend you to perform regular backups of your data, all the more prior to upgrading Gatling Enterprise to a new version.
{{< /alert >}}

For a simple single node setup (which we recommend if you're not experienced with operating Cassandra clusters),
performing a Cassandra backup simply consists of make a copy (eg, tar.gz) of the directories that are configured in
your `cassandra.yaml` file as the following entries:

* `data_file_directories`
* `commitlog_directory`
* `saved_caches_directory`

### Download {#download-cassandra}

Download and install [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/).

As of Gatling Enterprise {{< var revnumber >}}, we require at least Cassandra 3.10.
Gatling Enterprise has been tested against Cassandra 3.10 to 3.11.11, and against Cassandra 4.0.4.
If possible, we advise you go with the latest stable Cassandra 3.11 version.

{{< alert warning >}}
- We do not support AWS Keyspaces as an alternative of Cassandra.
{{< /alert >}}

### Deployment

Running a single node (without clustering) is a good start.

For an initial evaluation, you can host Gatling Enterprise and Cassandra on the same host.

If hosting Gatling Enterprise and Cassandra on the same instance, consider a 8 cores (4 cores with hyper-threading) host with 16Gb of RAM and 20Go of disk space.
Otherwise, considering a 4 cores (2 cores with hyper-threading) host with 8 Gb of RAM for each instance, and 20 Gb of disk space for Cassandra.

Gatling Enterprise itself requires little disk space, as only uploaded private keys are stored on Gatling Enterprise's host.

### Storage options

There are simple rules to follow when choosing the right type of instance to use for a Cassandra virtual machine:

- SSD is always best
- Avoid network disks

{{< alert warning >}}
For any cloud provider, make sure you use a storage system that support at least 3000 IOPS as we encountered slow downs with 1500 IOPS.
{{< /alert >}}

For AWS, avoid burstable instance types on AWS EC2 (T2/T3), they don't offer good performance for Cassandra deployments:

- C5d are equipped with NVMe SSD, which are great for installation running Cassandra and Gatling Enterprise on the same virtual machine
- I3 are better for virtual machines reserved for Cassandra

In Azure, use instances with the `s` prefix:

- FsV2 are great for installations running Cassandra and Gatling Enterprise on the same virtual machine
- LsV2 are better for virtual machines reserved for Cassandra

### Configuration

The default configuration is a good start.

Finally, remember the host you configured, as you will need it later to configure the contact points of Gatling Enterprise.
Keyspace creation will be handled by Gatling Enterprise.

{{< alert tip >}}
- For most use cases, one single Cassandra node suffice!
- Only run a Cassandra cluster if you need it and know how to operate it.
- In this case, make sure to configure replication properly in `frontline.conf`.
{{< /alert >}}

### Network Access

The Gatling Enterprise host needs network access to:

- your Cassandra cluster
- your source repository (if you want to build from sources)
- your binary repositories (if you want to download pre-packaged simulations), typically:
  * Maven central repository: [https://repo1.maven.org/maven2](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2)
  * Gradle plugins portal: [https://plugins.gradle.org](https://plugins.gradle.org)
  * or instead, the internal mirrors your organization might be enforcing
- the hosts where it will try to deploy Gatling injectors
- your cloud provider API (if deploying on-demand instances on public cloud providers)

{{< alert warning >}}
Don't forget to open the `22` (for SSH) and `9999` (for HTTP) ports on the injectors. If you don't, your runs will appear as `Broken`.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
Do NOT use a load balancer on a Cassandra cluster. The Cassandra network driver already does its own load balancing, adding a load balancer on top of it would break cluster communication.
{{< /alert >}}

### Rack and Data Centers

Cassandra new java driver uses data center as a mandatory value to initialize the client. Users who want to transition to a properly scaled cluster might need to adjust.

From the default configuration file, we can read:

```
endpoint_snitch -- Set this to a class that implements IEndpointSnitch.

The snitch has two functions:
- it teaches Cassandra enough about your network topology to route requests efficiently
- it allows Cassandra to spread replicas around your cluster to avoid correlated failures. It does this by grouping machines into "datacenters" and "racks." Cassandra will do its best not to have more than one replica on the same "rack" (which may not actually be a physical location)

CASSANDRA WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO AN INCOMPATIBLE SNITCH ONCE DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER.

This would cause data loss. This means that if you start with the default SimpleSnitch, which locates every node on "rack1" in "datacenter1", your only options if you need to add another datacenter are GossipingPropertyFileSnitch (and the older PFS).  From there, if you want to migrate to an incompatible snitch like Ec2Snitch you can do it by adding new nodes under Ec2Snitch (which will locate them in a new "datacenter") and decommissioning the old ones.
```

Cassandra default endpoint snitch is `SimpleSnitch`. Which defaults values of data center and rack to "datacenter1" and "rack1". They are hardcoded and therefore can't be changed.

When using other snitches (E.g., `GossipingPropertyFileSnitch`), Cassandra will use the content of the `cassandra-rackdc.properties` configuration file to build it's network topology or the private IP of the machine (E.g.: Ec2Snitch)

When scaling out, consider these two cases to migrate your (single) instance to a proper cluster configuration:

* Single instance (straighforward)
* Multiples instances of any snitches to any others (probably incompatible) snitches

First method being something like (also applies to cluster name):

```sql
update system.local set data_center = 'dc1' where key = 'local';
update system.local set rack = 'rc1' where key = 'local';
```

Second method implies (as stated in Cassandra documentation) to add instances with proper configuration and removing the old ones as you go in order to avoid data loss.

## Gatling Enterprise Server

### Download {#download-gatling-enterprise}

Gatling Enterprise is packaged as a zip bundle that can be downloaded from our downloads server (only for customers):

```
REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CUSTOM_GATLING_ENTERPRISE_BUNDLE_DOWNLOAD_LINK/frontline-bundle/{{< var revnumber >}}/frontline-bundle-{{< var revnumber >}}-bundle.zip
```

{{< alert tip >}}
Check the [documentation conventions]({{< ref "../introduction#custom-bundle-download-link" >}}) for ways to find your custom Gatling Enterprise bundle download link.
{{< /alert >}}

On launch, Gatling Enterprise will create or update the Gatling Enterprise schema in the Cassandra database.

### Launch {#launch-gatling-enterprise}

You can launch Gatling Enterprise in the background using the following command:

```
[... frontline-bundle ]$ ./bin/frontline
```

The web interface will then be accessible by default on port `10542`. You need to connect in order to fill in your license key.

Gatling Enterprise will log its PID and write it to a `pidfile` which names will also be echoed.
You can provide your own path to a custom pidfile this way:

```
[... frontline-bundle ]$ ./bin/frontline -p pidfile
```

Using the foreground mode will cancel the handling of a pidfile.

### Configuration

Check the `conf/frontline.conf` file for parameters you might want to edit.

```hocon
licenseKey = REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY <1>
```

<1> Provided license key, you should not edit this configuration directly from this file, Gatling Enterprise will ask for it when you launch it or when your current license is expired

```hocon
http {
  port = 10542 <1>
  cookieMaxAge = 604800 <2>
  ssl { <3>
    #certificate = "/path/to/domain.crt" <4>
    #privateKey = "/path/to/domain.key" <5>
    generateSelfSignedCertificate = false <6>
  }
  proxy { <7>
    #host = ""
    #port = 80
  }
}
```

* <1> Gatling Enterprise HTTP bind port
* <2> Cookies max-age in seconds (default: 7 days)
* <3> SSL configuration, activated if both `certificate` and `privatekey` are uncommented and points to valid files, or if `generateSelfSignedCertificate` is true.
* <4> Path to the certificate (or full chain) file. Must be an X.509 certificate chain file in PEM format.
* <5> Path to the private key file. Must be a PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 private key file in PEM format.
* <6> For testing purpose, you can make Gatling Enterprise produce a self-signed certificate
* <7> Optional HTTP proxy, enabled when both host and port are filled. This proxy will be used for every HTTP request to Cloud providers APIs and on-demand injectors.

```hocon
injector {
  httpPort = 9999 <1>
  enableLocalPool = false <2>
  kubernetes {
    disableTrustManager = true <3>
  }
}
```

* <1> Injectors HTTP listening port, so Gatling Enterprise can connect and collect the stats
* <2> Enable local injector pool (not for production use)
* <3> When connecting to your kubernetes API, determine if you want a true trust manager to be used to validate your certificate. Disabled by default.

```hocon
security {
  superAdminPassword = gatling <1>
  secretKey = "MUST BE CHANGED!" <2>
}
```

* <1> password for the Gatling Enterprise superAdmin account. Gatling Enterprise will create a new password when you launch it for the first time.
* <2> key for encrypting cookies. Must be 128, 192 or 256 bit (not bytes) long. Gatling Enterprise will create a new secretKey when you launch it for the first time.

```hocon
cassandra { <1>
  localDataCenter = datacenter1 <2>
  contactPoints = [{
    host = localhost
    port = 9042
  }]
  keyspace = gatling
  replication = "{'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1}"
  batchGroupingSize = 25
  credentials { <3>
    #username = "hello"
    #password = "world"
  }
  runsCleanup { <4>
    #timeOfDay = "15:10" <5>
    #maxRunsBySimulation = 30 <6>
    #maxRunAge = 100 <7>
  }
}
```

* <1> Can be adapted to your current Cassandra cluster configuration.
* <2> The local data center your contact points belong to. Cassandra's value with SimpleStrategy is "datacenter1".
* <3> The username/password credentials for connecting to Cassandra
* <4> You can configure daily cleanups for your runs in this part.
* <5> The hour of the daily cleanup, mandatory to activate the feature. The format is ISO 8601 (e.g.: 17:45).
* <6> The maximum number of runs by simulation. Can be combined with <7>.
* <7> The max age for the runs, in days. Can be combined with <6>.

* <8> JmesPath for firstname attribute in scoped user profile
* <9> JmesPath for lastname attribute in scoped user profile
* <10> JmesPath for email attribute in scoped user profile

There's no default value for those attributes, they must all be defined in the configuration file.

```hocon
grafana {
  #url = "http://localhost:3008/dashboard/db/frontline-requests" <1>
}
```

<1> Url to your Grafana dashboard using the Gatling Enterprise datasource (create a link in the Gatling Enterprise dashboard to the Grafana dashboard)

If you want to modify a value, don't forget to uncomment the line, by deleting the # sign. Any changes to the `frontline.conf` file needs a Gatling Enterprise restart to take effect.

See [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) documentation for more information on this format.

#### Permissions

- Execute permission to JDK path
- Execute permission to source control system client
- Execute permission to build tool client
- Read permission to unzipped Gatling Enterprise bundle
- Read/write permission to the logs directory
- Read/write/exec permission on tmp directory
If exec permission is not possible because `/tmp` is mounted with `noexec`,
you'll have to configure a different directory without `noexec`. Edit the Gatling Enterprise launch script and pass an additional System properties `-Djna.tmpdir=PATH_TO_DIR_WITHOUT_NOEXEC`.
If you don't you'll run into an issue such as `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/jna-3506402/jna4812891826558064540.tmp: /tmp/jna-3506402/jna4812891826558064540.tmp: failed to map segment from shared object: Operation not permitted`.

#### Logging

Gatling Enterprise uses the Logback library for logging.
By default, it will log on the filesystem, check logback.xml file.
Feel free to tune the default behavior if needed.

#### LDAP

Gatling Enterprise is able to use LDAP to manage its users. The LDAP mode has been tested with OpenLDAP, and Active Directory servers, but it should work with all regular LDAP implementations.

#### OpenID Authentication

Gatling Enterprise is able to use OpenID connect to manage its users. The OpenID Connect mode has been tested with One Login and Microsoft identity platform.
Configuration is described above under _oidc_.

By default, all registered users can connect as a global viewer and need an administrator to configure their permissions.

##### Sample OpenID configuration on Azure

- Go to "App registrations"
- Click on "New registration"
- Set the redirect URI to https://your-gatling-enterprise-url:your-gatling-enterprise-port/redirected
- Add a client secret in "Certificates & secrets" (we don't support certificates yet)
- Edit your `frontline.conf` file, configuration is described above, here is a sample configuration:

```hocon
oidc {
  discoveryUrl = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration"
  client {
    id = "******-*******-********-******"
    secret = "****************"
  }
  responseMode = "fragment"
  scopes = ["email", "profile"]
  jwksRefreshFrequency = 1440
  mapping {
    username: "email"
    firstname: "given_name"
    lastname: "family_name"
    email: "email"
  }
}
```

##### Sample OpenID configuration on Okta

- Navigate to admin => security => api => authorization server
- Make sure the openid, profile and email scopes are present
- Create an OpenId app
- Set the login redirect URI to https://your-gatling-enterprise-url:your-gatling-enterprise-port/redirected
- Copy client ID & client secret
- Assign people / groups to the app
- Edit your `frontline.conf` file, configuration is described above, here is a sample configuration:

```hocon
oidc {
  discoveryUrl = "https://your-organisation.okta.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration"
  client {
    id = "******-*******-********-******"
    secret = "****************"
  }
  responseMode = "okta_post_message"
  scopes = ["email", "profile"]
  jwksRefreshFrequency = 1440
  mapping {
    username: "email"
    firstname: "given_name"
    lastname: "family_name"
    email: "email"
  }
}
```

If the connection fails and the page is blank, check in the browser console for more infos.

#### Run Cleanup

Gatling Enterprise can be configured to automatically delete runs based on max-age and/or max number of runs by simulation.

#### Source Control System Client (typically git)

If you intend to have Gatling Enterprise build tests from sources,
it needs to be able to fetch the test sources from your remote source repository, ie:

- a client for your Source Control System (ex: git, svn, perforce, etc) to be installed on the Gatling Enterprise host
- this client to be in the PATH and executable for the user running the Gatling Enterprise JVM process

{{< alert tip >}}
If using Git to clone repositories using SSH protocol, Git 2.3 is the minimal version supported.
{{< /alert >}}

#### Build Tool Client (typically maven, gradle or sbt)

If you intend to have Gatling Enterprise build tests from sources,
then Gatling Enterprise needs to be able to build the fetched resources, ie:

- a client for your build tool (ex: sbt, maven, gradle, etc) needs to be installed on the Gatling Enterprise host
- this client needs to be in the PATH and executable for the user running the Gatling Enterprise JVM process

Make sure that the build tool is configured so that it is able to download artifacts, typically if your organization enforces repository mirrors.

Alternatively, if your projects include a build tool wrapper such as [Maven wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) (`mvnw`) or [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) (`gradlew`), then you don't need to install a build tool client. However, you must make sure the build tool wrapper script is able to download all its dependencies when running on the Gatling Enterprise host. 

{{< alert tip >}}
Maven 3.3.9 is the minimal version supported. This is the version shipped in Debian 9 (Stretch).
{{< /alert >}}
