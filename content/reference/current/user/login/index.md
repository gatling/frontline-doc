Logging in is necessary to use Gatling Enterprise. Gatling Enterprise is accessible by default on port 10542.

{{< img src="login.png" alt="Login button" >}}

If it is the first time you use Gatling Enterprise, you can use the super admin account with the following credentials:

- Login: *superAdmin*
- Password: generated by the configuration step or in the frontline.conf file. You can change it in the frontline.conf file.

If you have configured the OpenID authentication, all your user base can connect as a viewer. Make sure that Gatling Enterprise is allowed to open pop-ups on your browser, or you won't be able to login.
To connect as a superAdmin, click on *Connect with basic credentials* and fill as previously explained. To modify your users permissions, you'll need to go the [users admin page]({{< ref "../../admin/users" >}}), and modify the users.
