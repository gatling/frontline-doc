The reports can be accessed by clicking on the {{< icon chart-area >}} icon in the [simulations table]({{< ref "../simulations#simulations-table" >}}) or in the [runs table]({{< ref "../trends#runs-table" >}}).

This view introduce all the metrics available for a specific run.
This page consists of:

- [The run bar]({{< ref "#run-bar" >}})
- [The top navigator menu]({{< ref "#top-navigator-menu" >}})
- [Assertions]({{< ref "#assertions" >}})
- [The timeline]({{< ref "#timeline" >}})
- [Tabs]({{< ref "#tabs" >}})

## Run Bar

This bar is a combination of buttons:

- **Start / Stop**: Use this button to start a new run of the simulation, or stop the ongoing run (not available if you have a Viewer permission)
- **Generate public link**: To create a [public link]({{< ref "../reports#public-links" >}})
- **Export**: To [export]({{< ref "../reports#export" >}}) reports

{{< img src="run-bar.png" alt="Run bar" >}}

## Top Navigator Menu

The navigation menu allows you to choose the simulation time range.

{{< img src="timewindow.png" alt="Timewindow" >}}

## Assertions

The label below shows the status of the simulation (Ongoing, successful, timeout...).
If your simulation has assertions, you can click this label.
You can comment the run by clicking on the {{< icon comment-alt >}} icon.

{{< img src="timeline-assertions.png" alt="Timeline assertions" >}}

## Timeline

The timeline contains metrics of the full run providing an overview of the run.
Global information are available such as the resolution and the simulation name.

The resolution indicates the number of seconds per data point in the graph.

You can change the time range with control buttons or by selecting a region on the timeline:

{{< img src="timeline.png" alt="Timeline" >}}

## Tabs

Below the navigator chart, there are tabs to switch charts.
Each tab has the same structure except the summary that is available only for requests and groups tabs.

{{< img src="tabs.png" alt="Tabs" >}}

## Filter Bar

This filter bar is a combination of buttons:

- **Switch to Summary**: Switch to [summary]({{< ref "../reports#summary" >}}) view for Requests & Groups tabs
- buttons to filter the metrics drawn in the charts area

{{< img src="filter-bar.png" alt="Filter bar" >}}

## Charts

All charts in Gatling Enterprise are connected to each other, so if you select a time window on a chart it will automatically change it
for all other charts. Metrics are drawn in multiple charts.

{{< img src="charts.png" alt="Charts" >}}

Some of them have an icon to update the chart settings:

{{< img src="distrib-chart.png" alt="Distribution chart" >}}

Moreover, histograms and pies are hidden behind each count chart, accessible by clicking their top right corner icon below.

{{< img src="pie-button.png" alt="Pie button" >}}

{{< alert warning >}}
If your kernel version is too low (around below 3.10) you might not be able to get data from the TCP connection by state graph on the Connections tab. If you want to be able to get these data, you should upgrade your kernel.
{{< /alert >}}

## Summary (Requests and Groups only) {#summary}

This view is available only from requests and groups tabs.
It is a summary of metrics drawn in the charts, and has two modes: flat, by default, and hierarchy.
The summary is also connected to the timeline and the time window selected, so if you change the time window the summary
will refresh his data to match the time window.

On Flat mode you can filter the data by clicking any column name of the table.

{{< img src="summary.png" alt="Summary" >}}

## Generate Public Links {#public-links}

A public link is a link of the current reports which will be accessible to anyone, without having to log-in to Gatling Enterprise. To generate a public link, click on the *Generate public link* button and choose the expiration date of your link.

{{< img src="generate-public-link.png" alt="Generate public links" >}}

The maximum allowed lifetime for a public link is 1 year.

Choose an expiration date, then click the generate button.

{{< img src="successful-generation-public-link.png" alt="Successful public link generation" >}}

You can copy the public link to share your report to non-Gatling Enterprise users, or click on the "Go" Button to access it yourself. You can click on the "OK" button to close this modal.

## Export PDF

When clicking on the blue export button in the navigator menu, you will have access to a page where you can configure and then export a PDF report of a specific simulation run.

{{< img src="export-button.png" alt="Export button" >}}

This report is initialized with:

- a title element with the date of the run you were coming from
- the run status
- the run comments
- the run assertions
- the run requests summary
- 3 charts of the run:
* Requests and Responses per second
* Responses per Second by Status
* Response Time Percentiles

{{< img src="export-page.png" alt="Export page" >}}

This page is a configurable list of different elements that will be displayed in the report. You can click on the blue add button under every element
to add another one.

Every element can be moved up or down by clicking on the blue arrow on the top right of the element, or be removed by clicking on the red dash.

Those elements are composed of:

- **Title**: adds a title element.
- **Text Area**: adds an editable text element.
- **New Page**: allows you to skip a page in the report.
- **Run**:
  - **Status**: adds an editable text element with a predefined text set to the status of the selected run.
  - **Comments**: adds an editable text element with a predefined text set to the comments of the selected run.
  - **Assertions**: adds a table with the assertions of the selected run.
  - **Summary**: add sthe summary table of the selected run in a new landscape page.
- **Chart**: adds a chart element that you can interact with before exporting it to PDF.
- **Counts**: adds a count chart element that you can interact with before exporting it to PDF.

As you can see below, every charts (or other elements) can be interact with individually. You can zoom on it, or select the run, the scenario,
the group, etc.. whose you want your data to be fetch. You do not need to have the same settings for each element.

{{< img src="export-charts.png" alt="Export charts" >}}

After adding all desired elements in the report you can click on the *Export PDF* button on the top right to get your PDF file.

{{< img src="export-actions.png" alt="Export actions" >}}

There are two more actions you can do:

- **Save**: save the current Export configuration:
  - **as a template**: this option will save the element list without the content
  - **as a save**: this option will save everything, including the content of the Text Area and the configuration of the graphs
- **Load**: load a previously saved template or save.

## Useful Tips {#tips}

You can reset zoom by a double click on a chart.
It is possible to change the time range window by the following actions:

- Clicking zoom icons of the control buttons
- Select a zone in any charts and timeline
- Select a range time from the top navigation bar

### Markers

To ease your analysis, you can create markers on all the charts by right clicking on them. And click on the top of the marker to delete it.

### Multiple Highlights

In the top right menu, you can activate the *Multiple Highlights* setting which allows the tooltip to be displayed on every chart at the same time.

{{< img src="multiplecheck.png" alt="Multiple check" >}}
{{< img src="multiple.png" alt="Multiple" >}}

### Percentiles Mask

In the top right menu, you can click on the **Percentiles** setting to be able to chose what percentiles to display in the chart.

{{< img src="percentilesmask.png" alt="Percentiles mask" >}}
{{< img src="percentileschart.png" alt="Percentiles chart" >}}

### Date Time / Elapsed Time

In the top right menu, you can activate the **Date Time** setting to be able to switch from elapsed time to date time.

{{< img src="multiplecheck-date.png" alt="Multiple check" >}}
{{< img src="multiple-date.png" alt="Multiple" >}}

### Highlight Legend

If you hover your mouse over a label on the percentiles chart legend, you will be able to highlight the curve on the chart, leading to a better view of that curve.
The highlight legend option is enabled for every "non stacked" graph.
