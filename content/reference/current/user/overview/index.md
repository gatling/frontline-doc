Once you are logged in, you are now able to navigate using the FrontLine navigation bar on the left side.

{{< img src="navbar.png" alt="Navbar" >}}

FrontLine is composed of:

- **The Profile section**, letting a user manage his account settings (not accessible to the superAdmin)
- **The Admin section**, letting administrators manage teams, users, API tokens, private keys and repositories
- **The Simulations section**, where runs, trends and simulations can be seen and managed
- **The Pools section**, where you can configure your cloud and on-premises instances
- **The Documentation section**, displaying all documentation guides, the link to the Swagger for our public API, and samples for your FrontLine tests
- **The About section**, letting you know the current version of FrontLine and the expiration date of your license key
- **Log out**

We are now going to describe in depth each one of these sections.
