Like the others pools, an OpenStack Pool is a reference to the OpenStack account you want to use to spawn injectors to run the simulation. We only support Keystone version 3.
To configure the type of instances you want to spawn, you need to fill the form below:

- **Identity**: your OpenStack identity, it is most of the time: `domain:username`
- **Credentials**: Account password
- **Scope**: you can use scoped authentication (eg: `project:myprojectname`)
- **Region**: the region where to spawn your instances
- **Key Pair**: the Key pair name use by your image

- **Flavor**: the flavor used for your instances
- **Security Group**: the security group of your account
- **Username**: the username used by your ssh command to connect to the instances
