Logging in is necessary to use FrontLine. FrontLine is accessible by default on port 10542.

If it is the first time you use FrontLine, you can use the super admin account with the following credentials:

- Login: *superAdmin*
- Password: generated by the configuration step or in the frontline.conf file. You can change it in the frontline.conf file.

If you have configured the OpenID authentication, all of your user base can connect as a viewer. Make sure that FrontLine is allowed to open pop-ups on your browser, or you won't be able to login.
To connect as a superAdmin, click on *Connect with basic credentials* and fill as previously explained. To modify your users permissions, you'll need to go the [users admin page]({{< ref "docs/admin/users" >}}), and modify the users.
