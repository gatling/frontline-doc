## Accessing your profile

You can view your profile at any time by clicking on the {{< icon user >}} icon in the navigation bar.

{{< img src="profile.png" alt="Profile" >}}

The information displayed are the following:

- Username
- First and Last name
- Mail address
- Different roles

To update your profile, modify the fields you want to change, then click on the button **Update your information**.

You can't update your username here. You need to ask a System Admin to change your roles on the **Users Admin** page.

It should be noted that the superAdmin account doesn't have a profile.

If you are using FrontLine with LDAP, profiles will be read-only since users information are retrieved from the LDAP and not managed by FrontLine itself.
